//Class Notes from 5 March 2018 - Intro to Image Board Project

4 main parts to the project, 3 are high priority, 4th is more of a bonus but we should do it.
1 and 2 are straight forward, but part 2 is mostly image upload.
Part 3 is hard/big.

In index.js our routes will only be sending back JSON because it is a single page application

//Part 1:


v for thru each of the images and print out an element for each image.

when you do query to get the images out of the database:
function getImages() {
    db.query(`SELECT * FROM IMAGES ORDER BY created_at DESC`).then({rows} => {
        rows.forEach(function(image) {
            image.image = config.s3 + image.image
        })
    }
}
//later we will need to change the query to be:
function getImages(lastShownImageID) {
    db.query(`SELECT * FROM IMAGES LIMIT 10 ORDER BY created_at DESC WHERE id < $1`).then({rows} => {
        rows.forEach(function(image) {
            image.image = config.s3 + image.image
        })
    }
}

run sql query
then put it in a route to res.json
then make view instance when it mounts

set a property on itself and as soon as it is set, then view should
automatically update to show each of the images

image should be scaled down
with title
on a grid (flexbox or css grid);

in html is a big div where we set properties in our vue instance that causes it to display

//Part 2 Notes:
add the form for upload.
If you move on, then stop at the upload button next. We will talk about that tomorrow.
